            <p>
                The main activities of Monteria are livestock and agro-industry, encouraged by the fertility of the Sinú Valley. Most of the other activities are related to agro-industry, textile factories, food industry and retail companies. Most of the people that use the Chamber of Commerce services are business owners since the majority of other domestic/small companies are not registered against any government entity in order to avoid paying taxes. Business owners and entrepreneurs are the ones that uses the Chamber of Commerce services because it is a way to access to government and privated benefits.
